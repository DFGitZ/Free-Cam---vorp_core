What I'm bringing you today is something I saw in a fivem script and I've adapted it to work in vorp_core. Basically, what it does is the camera is moved by the mouse, so you can look everywhere. In the future I'm going to work on a DrawText3D to display the respawn count above the player.

***This is just a modification of VORP, not something I made from scratch.***
